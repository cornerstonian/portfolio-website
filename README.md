<h1>Deploy a Website Using Azure and GitHub (Automation, CI/CD)</h1>

VISIT SITE: https://kind-island-058855e1e.4.azurestaticapps.net/  

Deploying a static responsive website in Azure using GitHub involves integrating **Azure Static Web Apps** with a GitHub repository. This method automates deployments and is ideal for collaborative and CI/CD workflows.

**What is CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)?** is a practice in software development that automates the process of integrating code changes and deploying them to production. 

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day or as often as needed.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ensures that these changes are automatically deployed to production environments after passing tests, which gives us rapid and reliable delivery of software.

### **Steps to Deploy a Static Website Using Azure and GitHub**

### **1. Prepare Your Static Website and GitHub Repository**

1. **Prepare the Website Files**
    - Create a responsive website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Ensure all files are in a single directory (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `scripts.js`).
2. **Test Locally**
    - Verify that the website works correctly on your local machine.
3. **Push to GitHub**
    - Create a repository on GitHub for your project.
    - Clone the repository to your local machine:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/cornerstonian/portfolio-website.git
        cd portfolio-website
        
        ```
        
    - Add your website files to the repository:
        
        ```bash
        git status
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        git push origin main
        
        ```

### **3. Automated Deployment via GitHub Actions**

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
    - Azure Static Web Apps automatically generates a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository.
    - You can view it under https://github.com/cornerstonian/portfolio-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-kind-island-058855e1e.yml .

1. **Trigger the Deployment**
    - Push any changes to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow:
        
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update website content"
        git push origin main
        
        ```
        
    - The workflow builds and deploys your website automatically.
2. **Monitor Deployment**
    - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of the deployment.

---

### **4. Test Your Static Web App**

1. **Access Your Website**
    - After deployment, Azure provides a default URL for your website, e.g., https://kind-island-058855e1e.4.azurestaticapps.net/ .
    - Test the website and ensure it is responsive.

---

### **5. (Optional) Configure a Custom Domain**

1. **Purchase a Domain**
    - Use Azure Domains or a third-party registrar.
2. **Map the Domain**
    - In the Azure Portal, go to your Static Web App â†’ **Custom Domains**.
    - Add your custom domain and verify ownership by configuring a CNAME or TXT record in your domain registrar.
3. **Enable HTTPS**
    - Azure automatically provisions an SSL certificate for your custom domain.

---

### **6. Update Your Website**

1. **Make Changes Locally**
    - Edit your website files and fix the issues locally, push your changes to GitHub, repeat the process.
2. **Push Updates to GitHub**
